# Fibonacci Problem, Golden Ratio, and Largest Sum Subarray Problem

This repository contains solutions to three common programming problems: the Fibonacci problem, the Largest Sum Subarray problem, and a script to explore the Golden Ratio. Each problem is implemented in separate files.

## Fibonacci Problem

The Fibonacci problem focuses on finding the nth Fibonacci number. The repository provides an implementation using the exhaustive pattern approach. The code uses recursive function calls to calculate the Fibonacci number, but it is not efficient for larger values of n. The implementation is in C++.

To run the Fibonacci program, compile and execute the `fib_exhaustive.cpp` file. The program will calculate and display the 15th Fibonacci number using the exhaustive pattern.

## Fibonacci Golden Ratio

The Fibonacci Golden Ratio script explores the properties of the Golden Ratio, which is approximately 1.618033988749895. The script calculates the ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers and compares it to the Golden Ratio. It also calculates the Golden Ratio using mathematical equations derived from the Fibonacci sequence. The implementation is in C++.

To run the Golden Ratio script, compile and execute the `fib_part2b.cpp` file. The script will calculate and display the ratios of consecutive Fibonacci numbers and determine if they approach the Golden Ratio.

## Largest Sum Subarray Problem

The Largest Sum Subarray problem involves finding the subarray within an array that has the maximum sum. The repository provides an implementation using a brute force approach. The code iterates through all possible subarrays, calculates their sums, and keeps track of the subarray with the maximum sum. The implementation is in C++.

To run the Largest Sum Subarray program, compile and execute the `largestSumSubArray.cpp` file. The program will find and display the largest sum subarray for several sample inputs.
